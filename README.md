In this project, I created a 2023 movie database and analyzed it using the R programming language. The database includes variables such as movie name, opening week audience and revenue, total audience and revenue, IMDb score, number of weeks in theaters, movie runtime, and the number of screening locations. In the initial phase of the code, missing data were cleaned using `na.omit()`, column names were organized with `colnames()`, and data types were converted as needed. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to reveal the basic characteristics of the data. Correlation analysis was performed using `cor()` to examine relationships between variables and visualized with `corrplot()`. Movies were grouped using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods, with the optimal number of clusters determined by the "Elbow Method," and results were supported by dendrograms and scatterplots. In the visualization phase, scatterplots, histograms, box plots, pie charts, and bar charts were used to make the data more comprehensible. Analysis results and clusters were exported with `write.csv()` for use on different platforms. This project aimed to conduct an in-depth analysis and visualization of movie data to provide insights into the cinema industry.
